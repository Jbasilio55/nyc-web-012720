# Hashketball Review

## A Few Introductory Points

### How to participate in lecture
* Don’t wait for the answer
    * make a hypothesis based on the context and knowledge you have so far.
    * even if you don't plan on raising your hand, form a hypothesis in your head.
* Don’t be afraid to give the wrong answer.
* If you get tired or sleepy, do whatever it takes to stay awake.
    * jumping jacks
    * stand in the back
    * I don't care as long as it is not distracting others.

### How to make the most of the labs
* RSPEC and TDD --f-f
* please don't just keep guessing til' all the lights turn green.


## SWBATS
- [ ] Identify common data types in Ruby
- [ ] Use control flow to control a program's execution
- [ ] Explain what these iterators do:
    - [ ] #each
    - [ ] #select
    - [ ] #map
    - [ ] #find
- [ ] Create methods to organize code and reduce repetition

### Data Types/Primitives
* Strings  - some data representing text
    * to_i
    * to_f
* Integers - some data represting numbers
* Nil
* Boolean  - true or false
    * !!

### Data Structures
* Arrays
    * indices
    * how to access something.
    * when order matters (e.g. lines)
    * for storing data that is of the same type/structure
* Hash - like a dictionary, where key is the word, value is the definition.
    * keys
    * values
    * symbols

### Enumerable Methods in ruby
* each
* map - put whatever the block returns in a new array
* find - return the first thing that returns true 
* select - returns all the things that returned true

### Methods in ruby
* Implicit return
* Explicit return
* binding.pry
