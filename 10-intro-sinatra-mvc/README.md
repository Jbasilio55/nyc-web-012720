## Recap Mod 1:
Some of the things we Learned last Mod
* **Ruby** - Programming Language 
* **Objects** - modeling real world concepts
* **Domain Modeling** - Relationships between our objects
* **SQL** - language to interact with databse 
* **ORM** - Maping instances 
* **Active Record** - ORM
* **CRUD** - 







## Overview Of Mod 2:
By the end of this Mod you should be able to create a fullstack web application

* HTTP 
  * Request & Response
  * REST 

* Sinatra
  * MVC
    - Models: classes logic talks to the databse
    - Views: User interaction, frontend views, html
    - Controllers: Middle man
  * ERB
  * How CRUD actions map to RESTful routes

* Rails
  * Routes 
  * Rails helpers

* HTML/CSS






-------------------------------------------------


* What is a server? What is a client?
* Nothing Happens!!

* What is the request / response cycle?
  - Anatomy of Request
    - HTTP verb/method URL(GET, POST, PATCH, DELTE)
    - Headers
    - Body 
  - Anatomy of Response
   - Status Code
   - body 
   - headers 


## Intro to Sinatra
* Build a basic web app in 30 seconds
* Do basic web requests in Sinatra
* Explain what Sinatra is





---------------------------------------------------------

# GOALS (general):
* MVC
* ERB
* Params
* REST <=> CRUD

# GOALS (Detail):
- Explain the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern and give an example
  - Explain how web frameworks (like Sinatra/Rails) use the MVC pattern and why
- Define 'convention over configuration'
- Implement one model that inherit from ActiveRecord
- Implement one controller to route and process requests
- Params
  - Demonstrate how the params hash changes and where the data comes from
- Implement ERB template and get it to render data from controller and model
- Practice file structure in Sinatra
- Identify the connection between REST and CRUD

* Walk through `corneal new`
* Talk about `shotgun`
* Walk through Sinatra basic file structure
